### Task 3 Runtime behavior implementation  

Implement the intuitive pseudocode algorithm maxPartsum3 from the lecture (slide 19) in Python. Do not use object-oriented programming for this. In an additional variable, count the number of additions in the line sum += a[k].
Determine the runtime of the main loop of the program in nanoseconds, e.g. with time.time().
Pseudocode

Input: a sequence A of integer numbers in a user-selectable text file

Outputs: the maximum partial sum of A  
the indices of the first and last element of the partial sequence of A with the  
maximum partial sum  
the number of additions  
the required time

## Sheet 2

### Task 1 Runtime behavior implementation
Implement the two knapsack algorithms from the lecture in Java and in Python. Measure the time again and count how often the function max is called, resp.
how often the inner loop is run. Record your results in a table. Take the input data from the lecture and create a second data set with 20 items as input.
second data set with 20 items as input.

## Task 2 Greedy-Algorithm
Implement the algorithm presented in the lecture for returning change using the Greedy method (in Java or Python). You should not have an infinite change, but you have a cash register with a certain number of coins of each kind

**Input with keyboard:**
* The amount to be paid
* the given amount
* the available coin sizes
* the available quantities of each coin type

**Output with the terminal**
* the change
* coin size
* amount of coins, that are left. "Money exchange not possible" if there is not enough change.

### Task 3 Backtracking
Write a program that solves the 4-queens problem using backtracking. Can
your solution be extended to n queens?
