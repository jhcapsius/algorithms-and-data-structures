## Task 1 Runtime behavior implementation  

Implement the intuitive pseudocode algorithm maxPartsum3 from the lecture (slide 19) in Python. Do not use object-oriented programming for this. In an additional variable, count the number of additions in the line sum += a[k].
Determine the runtime of the main loop of the program in nanoseconds, e.g. with time.time().
Pseudocode

Input: a sequence A of integer numbers in a user-selectable text file

Outputs: the maximum partial sum of A  
the indices of the first and last element of the partial sequence of A with the  
maximum partial sum  
the number of additions  
the required time

## Task 2 Runtime behavior implementation  

Implement the same algorithm in Java (possibly using OOP).
