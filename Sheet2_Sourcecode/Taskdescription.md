## Task 1 Runtime behavior implementation
Implement the two knapsack algorithms from the lecture in Java and in Python. Measure the time again and count how often the function max is called, resp.
how often the inner loop is run. Record your results in a table. Take the input data from the lecture and create a second data set with 20 items as input.

## Task 2 Greedy-Algorithm
Implement the algorithm presented in the lecture for returning change using the Greedy method (in Java or Python). You should not have an infinite change, but you have a cash register with a certain number of coins of each kind

**Input with keyboard:**
* The amount to be paid
* the given amount
* the available coin sizes
* the available quantities of each coin type

**Output with the terminal**
* the change
* coin size
* amount of coins, that are left. "Money exchange not possible" if there is not enough change.

## Task 3 Backtracking
Write a program that solves the 4-queens problem using backtracking. Can
your solution be extended to n queens?
